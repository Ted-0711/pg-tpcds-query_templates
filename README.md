# pg-tpcds-query_templates

Modified query_templates of TPC-DS benchmark to accomodate various DBMSs (e.g. PostgreSQL and openLooKeng).

You can just replace the folder in the official tool with the one in this repository and generate queries as usual.

The folder names correspond to the following DBMSs:

- query_templates_pg -> PostgreSQL
- query_templates_lk -> openLooKeng
